		<h1>Buy Your Way to a Better Education up in Here!</h1>

		<p>
			Life itself is your professor, and you are in a state of constant learning, 
			now there are 3 kinds of people in the world: people that can count and 
			people that can't count. Which of the three are you?.  That's right!  
			All you need to get a 4.0 in this course. My education is about learning 
			what you didn't know even if know you that didn't know. <br/><br/>
			
			'Do you need homework today I think so however the moment I forget to assign 
			you homework there will be a scholar student to utter loudly 'We have homework...'
